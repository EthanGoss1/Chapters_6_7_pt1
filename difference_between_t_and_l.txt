The difference between tuples and lists are that you can edit items in a list, but not items in a tuple.
A list is a mutable object, while a tuple is an immutable object. Other various differences between them
are that lists use brackets, [], and tuples use parentheses, (), to hold data. The most important
difference between them is the fact that a tuple is unchangeable and a list is changeable.
